For this piece of work I have:

1st- Added ALT attributes to all the img tags.
Before:
[![img_tag_without_alt](/assets/screenshots/img_tag_without_alt.png)]

    After:
[![img_tag_with_alt](/assets/screenshots/img_tag_with_alt.png)]

2nd- Added main tag for SEO purposes before the section tag (containing a content class))

3rd - Added id attribute to the subsection so its nav bar link would redirect to the correct area.

    [![div_containing_id](/assets/screenshots/div_containing_id.png)]

4th - Replace div for footer tag in line 74 of the original code.

5th - Changed h2 tag in the footer section for h3.

6th - Changed the title of the website.

CSS

I have:

-Removed the section of styling that could be consolidated to prevent DRY.
    Before:
[![DRY_section](/assets/screenshots/DRY-section.png)]

    After:
[![fixed_DRY_section](/assets/screenshots/fixed_DRY_section.png)]

- Added class to a tags in the HTML nav bar to target them only, rather than all a tags.

a --> .nav-bar-links {

- Re-arranged the code so it follows the same order as the one that they have when displayed in live server.

- Added comments to differentiate sections and describe the stylings taking place.
